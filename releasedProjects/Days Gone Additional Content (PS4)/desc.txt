Days Gone is a story-driven survival-crafting game. I helped make the additional content for it. This content consisted of an Artbook and  a Soundtrack. The Artbook consists of chapters which consist of pages containing pieces of art. Users can select pieces of art to view in greater detail while some music plays in the background. Functionality exists for users to view 360Â° images and videos in the artbook. In the soundtrack users can play tracks from the game as they would from any other music player, there is functionality for seeking, playing, resuming, and downloading tracks (to an external USB or supported hard-drive). If the user wants to only download specific tracks, they can do so by "favouriting" those ones, and choosing to "download favourites".
