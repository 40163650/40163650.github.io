I once again had the chance to work in a team in my final year of University. Scrapitalism was an RTS whose premise was that Tim Curry wanted to escape to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1Sq1Nr58hM">the one place not yet corrupted by capitalism - SPACE!</a>

My role on this project was to implement the saving and loading functionality. I did this using JSON by serialising all the objects in the scene. In order to do this I used the JSON library by <a href="https://github.com/nlohmann/json">Niels Lohmann</a>.

If I were to go back to this project again I would add some encryption and decryption to the save files so that they could not be so easily edited by players.

Here is a video showing the completed game. It was completed using OpenGL again, but this time it did not rely on a framework that we were provided with.
