This was my first 3D graphical project. It used a framework similar to one that can be built by following the tutorial at <a href="https://learnopengl.com/">Learn OpenGL</a>.

It used a height map as an input to generate geometry from a mesh of quads. Then I used another map of my own making that dicatated the location of the street lights shown in the scene.

Other features include: A perspective camera, frustum culling, reflections of the skybox on the water, materials (textures, maps and property values), close to 400 point lights (using deferred rendering), a sun that changes colour as it sinks below the horizon, and a spot-light.

It was this project that inspired me to specialise in graphics programming, and what kicked off my post processing themed blog.
