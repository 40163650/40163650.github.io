Studying abroad in Amsterdam, I worked in a team for a real-world client - the fashion company G-Star. My team's task was to create a virtual-reality (VR) fitting room for the HTC Vive. Part of my role was to build the locomotion functionality, which I completed successfully using C++ and blueprints in the Unreal Engine. Additionally, I was tasked with modelling and motion capture work to create the prototype, for which I used a range of tools.

I worked using the Agile development method and was expected to work to an industrial schedule. At the end of each sprint I confidently presented the prototype's progress to G-Star staff, peers and their clients. I was readily able to answer their technical and project-related questions and discuss my planned work. This experience gave me a good understanding of working within real-life industry which I enjoyed thoroughly.

As part of this work I conducted market research, interviewing G-Star customers in store regarding their likes and dislikes with existing fitting rooms, and their desired features for a VR fitting room. In addition to developing methods of locomotion, I created new ways for users to interact with UX elements (models of clothing, doors, menus) in the VR fitting room. I also undertook pair-programming, to work collaboratively in creating a broad range of features; this technique enabled our group to maintain consistency within our codebase.

At the end of the project, the strength of my work was recognised by G Star who requested the use of my developments for their internal technology team as a starting point for creating their own version of the fitting room. In demonstrating my completed product, I was careful to adapt my presentation styles for different audiences including members of the public, clients and peers.
